# koreantranslator
This is an adapted version of a translation script using the KoNLPy package to help me in my early stages of learning the Korean language. This code takes a sentence in Korean and translates it into English, but not in the same way that Google Translate does. The Korean language is structured very differently from English, with the sentence object coming before the verb, and words being combined with prepositions that would be separate in english. Because of these vast differences, this code breaks the sentence up word by word and shows what each part of the sentence corresponds to in English, whereas Google Translate spits out a full sentence.
